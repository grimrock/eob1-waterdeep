 LEVEL 2
==========

- removed eob_wall_button_8  on  2,21
- removed eob_wall_button_9  on  7,18

in original there is small blue button from each side of the door

==========
 LEVEL 4 
==========
- when going from level 4 to level 3 one ends up at wrong locations
  removed stairs up from lvl4 that leads to lvl3, replaced with ladder & ceiling shaft & teleporter
  I know in original there are stairs, but this looks good and what is more important WORKS 
- fixed Tahorn, he is NOT an insectoid mage guys, tried to balance his numbers based on original + what other characters in grimrock are at lvl3
- button at 16,21 now also opens secret wall at same location to room with spider (cant find secret wall that would match color with other walls)

- removed dwarf cube from 26,18 as per original
- add dwarf cube to 27,17 as per original
- dwarf cubes at 26,13 and 27,17, set with counters, each needs to be pressed 2 times to open its cube, at least 10 sec apart (timer)
  unable to fetch the exact sequence from original
  but it seems that the plates that activates them must be pressed several times 
  its is definitely possible to open both by going south and north 2 times
  I also saw in original that only 27,17 was open - unable to reproduce yet though
- connected lever on 3,3 secret area to cube 16,4 (toggle) and removed the eob_ruins_wall_small_statue 16,3/16,5 (as the graphic doesnt fit to cube wall)

- add timer to replace hacked webs & eggs with fixed ones + spider spawner

done differently then original
- added secret when discovered illusional wall at 5,4
- drow clever at 11,18 is now spawned by special quest (otherwise the special quest on this level does nothing)
