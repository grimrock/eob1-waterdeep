Legend of Grimrock Scripting framework
==============

Reusable and modular scripting framework for Legend of Grimrock. It can be added to any existing LoG mod easily.
Core of the framework is a dynamic hook-framework (fw script entity). But it also contains other generally useful functions and script entities. 
fw script entity makes the usage of hooks much more versatile.

- Hooks can be created/removed or replaced in run time 
- Define hooks by entity type (eg. monsters, party or items) entity.name or entity.id. 
- Define multiple hooks of same type (eg. multiple party.onMove-hooks).
